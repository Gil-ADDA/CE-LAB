# Project Overview

Explain the purpose of your project, which is to detect two unique objects in the CE-LAB using an image classification model deployed on a phone.


# Table of Contents

# Getting Started

Explain how to set up Edge Impulse and any prerequisites for running the project on a phone.

# Data Collection and Preprocessing

Describe the process of collecting images of the two unique objects in the CE-LAB and how you preprocessed the images before training the model.
# Model Selection and Training

Discuss why you chose image classification over object detection, and describe the model architecture, training process, and any challenges faced.

# Deployment and Usage

Explain how to deploy the model on a phone using Edge Impulse, and provide instructions for using the app for object detection.

#Experiments and Results

Summarize the experiments conducted, their results, and any insights gained during the model selection and training process.
